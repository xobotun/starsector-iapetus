xobotun_iapetus,SHIP,"The Iapetus-class ships were the largest commercially-produced cargo carriers in the Domain. 

This is one of the rarest ships in the Persean sector, bearing Eridani-Utopia Terraforming Corporation logo. Presumably, it was brought into the sector to bring either a large swath of terraforming supplies or prefabricated orbital mirror segments. Usually such ships were used only to bring something that a fleet of Atlases were unable to carry, and had trips scheduled years ahead. It is unclear why this ship was abandoned.

Piloting this titanic machine is never an easy task due its sheer bulk and lack of maneuverability. This particular ship is supposed to be outfitted with a forward-facing energy projectors that help it traverse asteroid fields located around a hypothetical delivery area waiting for terraforming equipment.",,,,
